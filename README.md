# Scraper

Web Scraper is an app that will scrape the news articles from the Huffington Post. The app will display the article headlines, summary, image, and URL. You will also be able to add notes to the articles by clicking on the headline. After the headline has been clicked, a small form will pop up which will allow the user to input a name for the note as well as a text input field.
